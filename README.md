# NTCIP (ISSI Project)
This is a website for NTCIP's ISSI Project to facilitate the review of NTCIP 1200 series documents that are under development. Comments can be submitted online using the button provided on each page, which takes the user to https://github.com/k-vaughn/NTCIP/issues.

# Overview
This site consists of the following files

1. This Readme file
2. A page for each relavent NTCIP standard being produced, this currently includes:
   a. [https://k-vaughn.github.io/NTCIP/NTCIP_1201.html](NTCIP 1201 v04)
4. A page for [https://k-vaughn.github.io/NTCIP/20684_1.html](ISO 20684-1), which is a normative reference for NTCIP 1200 series standards; this page only shows section headings since the text of the document is under an ISO copyright.
5. A [https://k-vaughn.github.io/NTCIP/Conditionals.html](Conditionals) page, which is a traceability table that is used to show when support for a requirement is predicated on the support for another requirement
6. An [https://k-vaughn.github.io/NTCIP/OptionGroups.html](OptionsGroup) page, which is a traceability table that is used to show when multiple requirements are part of an option group to fulfil a user need.

The draft standards are presented in a table format generated from a requirements management tool (ReqView). Each row of this table has a unique ID. This id is used to maintain traceability, even when rows are reordered, deleted, etc. As such, the ID is not always sequential.

The left-hand pane of the documents provide a hyperlinked outline to facilitate jumping to relevant portions of the document. The Links column provides hyperlinks for all items that are traced to the relavent row of the table.
